==========  particlEd :: ToDo list  ==========

(-) add notices to modified TMW files;
    study terms of GPL (do I have to change headers "TMW project" or can I let
    them as they are?)

(-) options:
    - reload effect whenever it is changed on the disk?
    - verbose (particlEd is too verbose by default, which is bad)

(-) controller panel:
    - buttons (> play)(||pause)(stop)
    - time of effect's existence

(-) selecting a file:
    - particled can be started without an effect file given
    - button 'Open' -> dialog to open file

(-) window should be resizable (sometimes I find that effect needs much more 
    space - I should be able to add space without restarting)
    (I don't know if this is possible together with Guichan GUI...)

(-) tree-view of effect's internals

(-) TMW client doesn't have very useful error messages for malformed
    particle effects;
    write 'particle effect lint' - Ruby script which loads particle effect,
    checks if it makes sense and provides useful hints.
    Or rewrite parts of TMW processing XML...
