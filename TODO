==========  particlEd :: ToDo list  ==========

(-) add notices to modified TMW files;
    study terms of GPL (do I have to change headers "TMW project" or can I let
    them as they are?)

(-) some simple tool - like Ruby/Tk app - which simplifies selecting an effect

(-) keyboard controls:
    - main.cpp: implement method purgeParticles()
    - quit

(-) options:
    - loop (start effect whenever it ends or regularly after some time)
    - reload effect whenever it is changed on the disk?

(-) controller panel:
    - buttons (> play)(||pause)(stop)
    - time of effect's existence

(-) tree-view of effect's internals
