==========  particlEd :: ToDo list  ==========

(-) add notices to modified TMW files;
    study terms of GPL (do I have to change headers "TMW project" or can I let
    them as they are?)

(-) keyboard controls:
    - main.cpp: implement method purgeParticles()
    - quit

(-) window should be resizable (sometimes I find that effect needs much more 
    space - I should be able to add space without restarting)

(-) options:
    - fix -h (seems to be broken)
    - loop (start effect whenever it ends or regularly after some time)
    - reload effect whenever it is changed on the disk?
    - verbose (particlEd is too verbose by default, which is bad)

(-) controller panel:
    - buttons (> play)(||pause)(stop)
    - time of effect's existence

(-) selecting a file:
    - particled can be started without an effect file given
    - button 'Open' -> dialog to open file

(-) tree-view of effect's internals
