    particlEd
-------------------

ParticlEd is a small tool which displays particle effect defined in XML files
according to standard used in The Mana World (http://themanaworld.org).
It should help developers of particle effects to work quicker, without 
restarting TMW client again and again (restarting particlEd should be much 
quicker and less annoying).
In future particlEd should evolve from simple viewer to comfortable editor.

HOW TO BUILD

Unfortunatelly I am not familiar with autotools, so you'll have to undertake
a possibly painful building procedure:

1. get all libraries and header files needed to compile TMW client from source
   [PhysFS, Guichan, SDL & affiliates]
2. modify makemake.rb (just list of header locations at the top of script)
3. get some interpreter of Ruby if you haven't got it
4. run 'ruby makemake.rb' to generate Makefile
5. run 'make'

USAGE

1. Options

'particled -h' shows you list of options.

The only required argument is particle effect file name relative to directory
where you execute particled (or another directory if you use -d option)

Very important is option -d, which specifies TMW data directory.
particlEd presumes that directory specified by -d (or current working
directory if not given this option) is TMW data directory,
which contains subdirectory graphics.

Examples:

[~]$ particled -d ./tmw/data graphics/particles/hit.particle.xml
-d option is used; effect file location is then relative to the given
directory, not to current working directory

[~/tmw/data]$ particled graphics/particles/hit.particle.xml
I haven't used -d option, so current working directory is set as data dir;
however, I can't give effect file name './graphics/particles/hit.particle.xml',
because physFS would reject it as insecure.

2. Keys:

r - starts new effect (by repeated pressing of 'r' you can achieve many same
    effects at the same place)
n - removes all effects and starts one new

AUTHORS

Most of the code of particlEd is simply copied from TMW tree; so TMW developers
are authors of code, I'm just "editor" who has cooked something else from
what they had written before. (On the other side - I can't blame TMW developers
for crappiness of particlEd.)
