    particlEd
-------------------

This is first public version of particlEd, small tool which displays
particle effect defined in a XML file according to the standard
used in The Mana World (http://themanaworld.org).
It should help developers of particle effects to work quicker,
without restarting TMW client again and again (restarting particlEd
should be much quicker and less annoying).

HOW TO BUILD

Unfortunatelly I am not familiar with autotools, so you'll have to undertake
a possible painful building procedure:

1. get all libraries and header files needed to compile TMW client from source
2. modify makemake.rb (just list of header locations at the top of script)
3. run 'ruby makemake.rb' to generate Makefile
4. run 'make'

USAGE

'particled -h' shows you list of options.

The only required argument is particle effect file name relative to directory
where you execute particled (or another directory if you use -d option)

Very important is option -d, which specifies TMW data directory.
particlEd presumes that directory specified by -d (or current working
directory if not given this option) is TMW data directory,
which contains subdirectory graphics.

Examples:

[~]$ particled -d ./tmw/data graphics/particles/hit.particle.xml
-d option is used; effect file location is then relative to the given
directory, not to current working directory

[~/tmw/data]$ particled graphics/particles/hit.particle.xml
I haven't used -d option, so current working directory is set as data dir;
however, I can't give effect file name './graphics/particles/hit.particle.xml',
because physFS would reject it as insecure.

LICENSE

particlEd is work derived of software project released under GNU/GPL and
thus it will be released under GNU/GPL itself, as soon as I do 
all the necessary "legal operations" such as writing notices into
modified files.

AUTHORS

Most of the code of particlEd is simply copied from TMW tree; so TMW developers
are authors of code, I'm just "editor" who has cooked something else from
what they had written before. (On the other side - I can't blame TMW developers
for crappiness of particlEd.)
